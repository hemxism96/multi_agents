Bay
good morning everyone we are pleased to welcome you for our 2023 Financial
results uh this presentation will be made by LCA Deo CEO of run group Ander Pon CFO of run group and will be
followed by a cation Luka the floor is yours thank you thank you hello everyone
uh so and thank you for being with us so you know in the life of a company every moment is a is a challenge and
especially in automotive and especially in our times you can actually never be sure where you will stay in the game but
um sometimes people that do my job uh get the most important reward I
would say a leader can have and because you realize that you have the right team you have the right
mindset uh and that you have created a dynamic that will keep your performance
sustainable so and apparently we also kind of keeping our competitors
awake even forcing them to wake up very very early in the morning so I want to
take the opportunity to congratulate them for the excellent results uh so shapo as we say in French
but you will see that we also have to bring a few uh good news so
Renault group financial performance is actually higher than it has ever been in
more than a century it's simple in 20123 we are breaking records on every
major Financial kpi we outperformed the guidance that we had already raised in
June in 2023 we achieved a record operating margin of 7.9% this is actually two points above
our initial guidance at the beginning of the year and uh we generated three
billion of uh free cash flow for Rena is something
historic over the decade before the covid we generated less than um 1
billion per per year on average so this number shows that uh we have changed
something structural in the system uh it's the first time that the
machine is designed to deliver financial performance and the beauty of the thing is that we have managed to put the
product back at the core of our strategy while we were very busy
restructuring the company the fact uh that this is a solid work uh is even
more obvious if you look not only at the snapshot but all at the old movie so in
only 3 years we went from record losses to record results constantly improving
our operational performance and this powerful Dynamic is the result of
in-depth work that we have been doing and that we are still doing uh on our
lineup on our commercial policy on our cost structure and of course on our
organization this new breed of you know type of organization that we have uh put in
place is designed to uh capture value on all new Automotive value chains through
dedicated and focused businesses we call it the NextGen automotive company the
idea behind is very simple the automotive landscape is being radically transformed instead of one sport we now
have to play at least five different disciplines address five different uh
value chains and tap into five different profit pools so to excel in this five
sports we need five type of athletes each of them 100% focused these are
power ampair Alpine mobilized and neutral when I arrived at Renault what
uh struck me was the complexity of its structure it was a
matrix organization with too many dimensions Brands regions countries
functions and of course also the alliance you can ask any philosopher they will tell you that Beyond three
dimension you you are already already in the space of metaphysics so we've
stopped with metaphysics we killed the metrix organization we have created focus on what matters and uh we have
plugged the company onto the new value pools we approv transparency and
accountability at the level of the businesses where the things are really happening every day
and every day this organization supports our Relentless quest for performance
Improvement and capital allocation optimization so cost reduction will
remain and remains our Obsession I confirm that we are going to reduce cost of EVS by 40% thanks to a pair for ice
and hybrid cars we will achieve 30 30% uh cost reduction by 2027 we push our efforts well beyond our
traditional scope we have dramatically increase our control on our value chain
traditionally C makers dealt only with tier one suppliers in a very classical
way supply chain was a black box in a way we have opened it and this is what
we do when we deal for example with Qualcomm or when we C- develop with st
micro Electronics with Val and uh and many others so our horizontal approach
is an additional level of performance Improvement allowing us to share investment and risks all along all along
the value chains that we have to cover we are also pushing the limits to
reduce development time a few years ago it took us at least four years to De
develop a new car now we're developing the new EV twingo in around two years
all these efforts are boosting Renault group's Capital efficiency so we'll
achieve over 30% roochi by 2025 and remember we started
from zero in 2021 besides um performance Improvement
our new organization supports our second Mantra this is strategic agility and
flexibility to address the ongoing Automotive transition we have designed the next gen comp
to be ready to smartly adapt to the changing pace of markets and
Technologies of course the end game is clear but we know that there will be ups
and downs to get there we are all set for the journey thanks to two clear
assets allowing us to play the smooth transition and on the one end this is
our EVN software Champion tailored to outpace the EV pure players in the race
towards EV ice price parity and Power in a horse on the other hand generating
cash drisking the group racing to reinvent the ice technology through
smart hybridization synthetic fuels and ultra low emission Solutions and of
course out there are also mobilize the futur is neutral and Alpine to support
the group business model with differentiating products and solution on
the new Mobility Services circular economy and profitable high-end uh car
value chains boosting strategic agility also uh has also been our key objective
when we have uh reshuffled our alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi at the core
of this new alliance we have put operational projects that have the potential to generate hundreds of
millions of Euros every year each company is free to move for forward with
its own projects and uh the others can join not
because they have to but because it makes business sense my job now is to leverage this
great dynamic in the teams to take advantage of a unprecedented product life cycle pushing
the system to secure long-term performance and to catch new grow growth
opportunities I will tell you more about that in a few minutes but before that t will go more in detail on the financial
results thank you Luca and uh good morning and thanks again to all of you for for joining us um so I'll go
straight into the financial performance uh starting with the revenue so our group Revenue was up
13.1% in 2023 at 52.4 billion EUR at constant exchange rate
it was up 17.9% Mobility Services amounted to 45 million e up 10 million compared to last
year the revenue from our captive Finance Company mobilized Financial Services grew
31.8% to 4.2 billion euros mostly driven by the rise in interest rates and by a
strong increase in average Finance amount let's draw down now in the uh Automotive Revenue Automotive Revenue
stood at 48.2 billion for the year up 11.7% at constant exchange rate it was
up 16.5% Forex was a negative by 4.8 points
and mostly linked to the Argentinian pezo devaluation and to a Le lesser extent the Turkish era the volume and
Geographic mix buckets together were a positive at 5.7 points volume wise the
group registered 2.2 million units in the year a 9 % increase compared to
20202 2022 sorry All Brands contributed to this grow growth in 2023 Rono brand
was the best selling French brand in the world with a 99.4% growth in Europe the
brand moved from fifth to second place in the passenger car and lcv Market in
Light commercial vehicles in particular with a 25.7% growth Reno took the second
place and was first in commercial Vans Dasa sales were up nearly 15% worldwide
the new brand identity is proving very successful month after month in Europe its core Market the brand confirmed its
second place on the retail channel the extreme trim level launched on all
vehicles at the beginning of 2023 now represents a third of orders across the entire range attracts new customers and
crucially generates incremental contribution margin alpen continued its
double digit growth in the high-end segment for the third consecutive year with more than 4,000 units sold it
delivered a 22% growth versus 2022 from a geographic perspective sales
in Europe were up 18.6% a strong outperformance versus a market up
13.9% this market share gain was mostly driven by our product our product offensive more on this later hono group
moved up to the third place among car manufacturers in Europe and this led to a higher mix of European sales and
explains the positive 1.7 points of geographic mix effect for the overall
group The 9% growth in retail sales translated into a 4% volume effect as
the increase in registrations was was partially offset by a lower restocking in the independent dealers Network in 23
compared to 22 in particular in the fourth quarter of the Year Global inventory stood at 484000 units at the
end of December compared to 480,000 units in December of 2022 this is better
than the objective that we had communicated to you of being below a Total distribution stock of 500,000
units by the end of the year and allows us to enter 2024 with a very healthy
inventory position this should also be put in perspective with the still high order
book which stands at 2 and a half months of forward sales it reflects the success
of our launches and remains above our Target level of two months
plus in 2023 we benefited from a strong price and product mix effect all in all
they represented 8.4 points the price effect was a strong positive at 7.4
points for the four year as anticipated even if it continues to be strong it
started to ease uh mostly due to tougher comps and less pressure to offset raw
materials the price effect was mainly driven by performance in the following areas first a continued discipline in
Channel mix almost two-thirds of our sales are made in the retail Channel and
specifically 50% for the Rono brand in Europe secondly a strong control over V
variable marketing expenses which includes incentives to dealers thirdly
the continued favorability of our trim mix thanks to the attractiveness of the range and finally pricing power that
allows us to more than cover adverse exchange rate impacts where
necessary switching to the product mix effect it stood at positive one point mainly thanks to the success of orral
espass and lcvs a lower figure in the second half of the Year mainly results
from a strong sales performance from Kio which has a revenue per unit that's below the group's average nonetheless as
you will see the model the model mix is positive for our margin in the second half of the year it drove a 50 basis
points positive effect on the group's operating margin let me give you an update on the
products that supported this performance starting with mean mean Tech
is still the number one EV of its segment in France in 2023 it ranks number three of its segment in Europe
even with volumes that are below the levels we anticipated at the the time of the launch this car remains a conquest
product in Europe with more than 50% of our clients which are new to the Runo brand in 2023 we sold 47,000 units of
which 70% are higher trim versions and over 80% are equipped with the most
powerful powertrain by the way the residual value of Megan continued to increase in
2023 in the meantime we worked hard on costs in line with the road map detailed
last November during the aare CMD because we started to benefit from the first cost reductions on the vehicle we
also started to reflect it in the price of mean to ensure that it remains
competitive in France orral became the leader of the retail CSV segment and
Reno Brown the leader in the C segment in 2023 orral sales amounted to more than
86,000 units in the year 100% were electrified and 62% were ech 4 hybrid
60% were were configured in the highest trim levels orral is a car with
outstanding financials and delivers historical levels of contribution margin
the record though now belongs to the car on the next slide which is none other than espass isass is an important
Conquest product on the D segment it enjoys an 80% commonality rate with austral this enables it to deliver
record contribution margin even though we reduced its selling price compared to the previous generation isest sales are
off to a good start 80% of the sales are in the high trim level in age two of 2023 we also
introduced the new Cleo with the E Tech hybrid version further in reinforcing the group's offensive on
electrification Cleo was the best selling vehicle in France in 2023
and is now number three in Europe thanks to significant cost improvements it's
posting a higher contribution margin than the previous generation while its price is actually lower as you will see
later with Luca this hono lineup will be strengthened by important launches in
2024 daa's four pillar models all grew in 20123 with two vehicles on the podium of
retail sales in Europe sander was the second car sold in Europe last year and
Remains the top seller on the European retail Market since
2017 dusia spring recorded close to 62,000 sales in Europe in 2023 this car
is the most affordable EV in Europe and was the third bestselling electric
vehicle to retail customers last but not least despite approaching the end of its life the
current duster was number two of retail SUVs in Europe new duster will be launched in the upcoming months and will
ensure the continued success story of Dasia are double digit
brand switching to Alpine Alpine a 110 maintained a strong momentum driven by
the success of the limited editions Alpine starts 2024 with a seven months
order book thanks for example to the successful start of the A110 R Trini
launched in December in a nutshell the success of our lineup fed the revenue
growth it was also a key driver for our operating performance and I'll come back
to this in a moment to finish the analysis of the revenue change our sales to Partners
contributed positively for 2.1 points they benefited from the production of
Colt and ASX for Mitsubishi and illustrates the common projects that we're restarting with the alliance we
also benefited from a dynamic lcv Market driving our sales to Nissan Rono trucks
and Mercedes now let's move to profitability in 2023 we increased our
profit by more than 60% delivering 4.1 billion EUR which is 7.9 of% of Revenue
up 2.4 points versus 2022 this is at the top of our guidance
which as Luca mentioned we had already increased last June this performance is
driven by the progress of the operating profit of our Automotive segment which stood at 3.1 billion EUR or
6.3% of Auto Revenue we basically more than doubled our Automotive segment of
profit versus 2022 our financing activity mobilized Financial Services delivered a 1.1
billion Euro contribution this slide showcases our
fast and strong transformation throughout the last 3 years 7.9% operating margin is the new record as
mentioned for the group in Age Two we reached 8.1% we're closing the Gap with some of
our competitors but this is not the end we're 100% focused on continuing to improve our operational performance year
after year in 2023 our operating margin increased by 1.5 billion euros the
biggest contribution came from Price mix and enrichment for almost 3 billion
price mix and enrichment taken individually were all strong profit
contributors in H1 and in H2 this reflects our commercial policy the
Vitality of our lineup this effects obviously way more than compensated the
strong cost headwinds despite good operational cost performance our cost of goods hold
increased year on-year about 1.6 billion Eur this was primarily driven by raw
materials and other input costs namely Logistics energy and labor cost raw
material weighed for 216 million after almost 350 million negative in H1 the
trend reversed in H2 Logistics and energy cost continued to weigh in H2
despite a meaningful sequential Improvement after 1.2 billion of cost
effect in H1 the pressure is is now easing very significantly looking at sgna they
increased by 389 million EUR mainly driven by the marketing cost due to the
ongoing product offensive and by labor cost most of the positive 376 million
EUR in the other item are explained by price increases in Rono group
subscription plans in Argentina in this country Rena as other oems offers a
subscription plan in which individuals can collectively contribute towards the purchase of a
vehicle as you remember a few words on horse as you remember in November 2022
we announced Our intention to merge our ice and hybrid powertrain and gearbox business with G's equivalent activities
and form a world leading supplier since the announcement and in accordance with
IFRS 5 we reclassified horses assets and assets H for sale and seized their
amortization in 2023 this resulted in non-cash positive effect on our
operating margin which amounted to 482 million EUR which is 398 million more
than in 2022 as stated it's non-cash so we had no impact on free cash flow in 23
restated from this impact the group operating margin would have been 6.6% in H1 and 7.3% in age2 up 0.7 points
sequentially clearly performance continues to improve whether you include the impact of horse or not the JV
agreement was signed in July and the closing of the deal is currently pending
approval from antitrust and foreign direct investment authorities until closing the freeze the freeze of
amortization will continue to have a non-cash positive impact every month
when the deal closes we will deconsolidate horse and consolidate our share of the combined Equity uh entity
on an equity basis at this point the amortization of horse assets will resume
and be included in the price that we pay for the power trains horse will take a margin as a supplier and synergies will
more than compensate this margin from the second year all in all for 2024 we took an assumption of a slight
negative impact from horse on operating margin this number has to be compared with a positive impact of 482 million
just mentioned these effects are taken into account in the 2024 operating margin guidance that
we'll cover later on now let's comment on the performance of mobilized Financial
Services mobilized Financial Services generated 21 billion EUR of new
financings up 17.1% thanks to the gr growth in
registrations compounded with a 9.9% increase of the average financed amount
average performing assets amounted to 51.2 billion a 6.4 billion uh uh uh
increase versus 2022 driven by both new retail and wholesale financing the
latter due to the return of more normal dealer inventory level levels post
Electronic Component shortages net banking income as a percentage of average performing assets was negatively
impacted by the reversal of positive swaps Valu impact observed in 2022 and by the
higher mix of dealer inventory financing with lower margins cost of risk at
0.29% remained at a very low level both for wholesale and Retail overall
mobilized Financial Services posted an operating profit of 1.1 billion euros
excluding the non-recurring impact of swaps this represents an 8% Improvement
versus 2022 moving to the key items from our group p&l below the operating margin uh
line the other operating income and expenses were impacted mainly by four elements first the € 880 million EUR
Capital loss related to the disposal of Nissan shares and non-cash items as you
already know secondly assets impairment uh linked to vehicle developments and
specific production assets third restructuring costs and Fin on the positive sides the impact of asset
disposals which amounted to 323 million EUR the slight deterioration of our net
Financial income and expenses is explained by the impact of hyperinflation in Argentina partially
compensated by the positive impact of the rise in interest rates on our net cash
position profit from Associated companies Rose primarily due to Nissan's
contribution which stood at 79 7 million e compared to 526 million posted in
2022 as a reminder we adjust Nissan's jgap results to convert to IFRS key
adjustments concern the valuation of Nissan stake in Mitsubishi Motors for €
228 million EUR and deferred tax retreatments current and deferred tax
represented a charge of 523 million stable compared to 22 the effect in the
pre-tax income the increase sorry in the pre-tax income was driven by the operating performance Improvement but it
was offset by the evolution of deferred taxes the effective tax rate for 2023
was close to what is going to be normative levels all in all net income
strongly improved by more than 3 billion reaching €2.3 billion EUR net income
group share reached 2.2 billion EUR from the start of reolution return
on total capital on Capital employed has been a key indicator for us you can see
on this slide that as Luca mentioned we made remarkable progress in the last three years confirming what Luca said
about the transformation from 0 in 21 we're now close to 30% which was our commitment
for 2025 now let's cover how this translates into our cache Performance Reno group
generated 5.5 billion EUR of cash in 2023 this is a record for the group and
reflects all the work that we've carried out to build a much stronger fundamentals to underpin our performance
this figure included a 600 million dividend inflow from MFS compared to 800
million in 2022 group capex and R&D excluding the
the the impact of asset disposal amounted to 7.3% of Revenue versus 7.4%
last year disposals represented a 282 million cash inflow the change in
working capital requirement was positive 637 million EUR and is mainly related to
the decrease in our inventory levels finally restructuring cash out amounted
to 496 million EUR as a result we generated 3 billion of free cash flow
which is one more new record excluding ms's dividend it stood at 2.4 billion
EUR against 1.3 billion in 22 up 1.1 billion don't forget that this free cash
flow was generated while funding on PA development it shows that we now have
ample capacity to continue to do so this record- free cash flow alongside
with around €200 million Eur inflow from the sale of the 24% Equity stake in
Alpine racing LTD and the positive impact from Nissan shar's disposal uh
strongly contributed to a significant improvement in our Automotive Financial position all in all our net financial
position Rose by 3.2 billion to reach 3.7
billion the liquidity of the automotive division stood at a very comfortable
level of 17.8 billion at the end of December as you know most of the
agencies covering the T the the stock have upgraded their Outlook of the rating of onog group for
2023 rewarding our stakeholders is very important for us we will therefore
submit to the approval of our shareholders at the next general assembly a dividend of 1.85 EUR per
share payable in cash it means a 17 Five payout ratio improving significantly our
dividend yield then as we make progress towards our first priority which is to
return to investment grade the dividend will gradually grow in a discipline fashion with a goal to reach 35% of
group Consolidated net income PA and share this concludes the financial
section Luca back to you for the 24hour Mery so let's uh now look rapidly at uh
what come comes next uh so good news 2024 it's all about
products um we'll be launching basically one car every month in average this has
uh never seen before uh at Renault some some of those products will be very
unique uh boosting our competitiveness the Rena 5 of course this is a return of a legend this is our
Ace to democ size next gen EV and software um probably the best uh small
EV in the world right now we will unveil it uh in Geneva in a matter of 10 days
so then we have the scenic this is one of the first European EVS designed to touch the heart of the European market
families user choosers in uh in corporate fleets uh a product that is
very very competitive versus comparable IC models in cost of ownership and
performance in usage uh this is a product that is also showing the future
Mater materializing our vision of what we mean when we talk about sustainability and the product that's
well position in terms of price versus competition actually very well very well
then we have the new Master we call it the aan because of its uh Cutting Edge
technology and also AO Dynamics it will have the best consumtion performance
both in electric and Ice version we are convinced it will reinforce our
leadership in lcv in the European market as a as a brand and now we have the
Renault 4 uh will be another instant classic I'm
sure you will see uh more about the final version at the end of of this year
and alongside our EV push for ano we continue to develop our range of e tech
hybrid cars supporting our renewed Global ambition for example with
SOS uh this is the ideal small family SUV that uh we have just revealed last
week I think we have one of the our best kept secrets and potentially one of the
good surprises in the Renault lineup it's nice it's practical and it's very
competitive uh in price we'll also also have Rafal uh so since long time Renault
didn't have such a strong proposition at this uh level of the market uh it's
going to turn heads and but also turn some given ideas about our potential to
grab some share at that level of the of the of the of the market and for us it
will represent a very very good additional uh business we just open orders also last week in 2024 we will
also have major launches in Latin America turkey Morocco and Korea among
other countries this is the start of the attack plan we have organized for international market which will develop
in the next 36 months and of course I don't want to forget our corporate
darling this is data uh will renovate the spring uh which is one of the most
successful EVS in Europe as the said just after 3 years it will be more
performant nicer and even cheaper but the big event of the year
for this brand is the launch of the third generation of dusta so far the most popular SUV in Europe so looking at
the reaction of Automotive price uh dealers and customer I think this car will be a
blockbuster and last but not least 2024 will be the year where we start the new
Alpine Journey with the a290 so will be easy but we like that uh
especially when it come it's about introducing our creations and our Technologies so in 2024 the reolution
will really materialize into our cars I want to also to reassure you that
while our production and marketing and salese will be very busy launching we're
not going to let the product fireworks distract us from our fundamentals we'll keep extremely
focused on cost discipline especially in those uh three areas first we'll push
the envelope on the EV site in November we presented our road map to achieve 40%
cost reduction and reach EV I price parity before the competition in fact we
have already started the journey you saw it concluded with the price position of the cic and drono 5 Second Transforming
Our industrial base uh puts us on track to reduce production cost by 30% % for
ice and hybrid cars and by 50% for EVS by
2027 for example deploying predictive maintenance AI tools resulted this year
in a 270 million euro saving on uh on on
energy and and maintenance so the the thing is for Real uh for sure and
finally we have made a huge step on how to master as I said before energy efficient efficiency in 2 years only we
have reduced the energy consumption per vehicle in our plants by 20% again
through AI monitoring and we'll go further with a 30% reduction Target by
2025 compared to 2021 and even a 40% reduction in the French
plants all this will result in operational Improvement and strong CL
cash flow generation in 2024 we H to achieve over 7.5% of operating margin and will
generate over 2.5 billion of uh free crash row so this year is going to be
again a year of focus discipline execution but uh don't count on us to
switch to cruising mode we know what that what comes in the next Automotive
you know sector will be no walk in the park only those able to anticipate the
next Technologic shifts uh so adapting getting prepared
to turn the next disruption to opportunities to reinvent our industry will have a future we are totally
comfortable with that uh scenario it's a chance for a challenger like uh Rena
group so as you can imagine this is precisely what we are cooking and preparing back into the kitchen so thank
you for your attention uh I now will open to your question so stay with us if
you can for the Q&A thank you Luca so we will now enter
the Q&A session um and we will start with a question from Danielle Rosa Benin
Danielle please could you open your mic good morning everybody um Luka I'd
like to ask you about your medium-term view on pricing for PV and Ice cars you already man made some comments but how
do you see the price points evolving in the long term and will there be any meaningful difference between them right
do you think consumers will perceive EVS as better cars and have a higher willingness to pay or will it be the
other way around that actually EV cars might need to be cheaper than ice cars in the long
run uh I think for you know for the for the for this generation Next Generation
203 there will always be a slight difference in in um in pricing
especially four cars with bigger batteries of course when you go into small cars where can we can you can
really reduce the size of the battery because the usage of of the thing is different maybe you will find you know
more competitive uh you know BV offer to ice that that's the kind of of course
everybody's trying to reduce the cost of EVS to look for Price parity of the
thing but you know we always discuss about price list but in fact what we should look at is the you know total
cost of ownership of of the thing um so you already see on the scenic that when
you calculate the total cost of ownership including the electricity that you want to use to you know run I don't
know 30,000 km a year um I think uh or in three years sorry I think that this
is already comparable to the hybrid so we got there we didn't go to the least price parity but I'm sometime asking
myself whether this this is the real uh you know uh important uh criteria that
uh will motivate a customer to consider a car or not so this is the way I see it
so you will see probably reduction of price of EVS uh and but this
generation apart from some segments this is not necessarily going to happen but I'm not sure it's the real important
thing another element and I finish here because I leave it you know I have to leave leave time for the other question
is that we have to be very careful on how do we manage in general the residual
value of EVs and uh I think that uh Renault the way we are doing it is a a
very balanced and long-term uh let's say uh minded and driven approach and this
is the most dangerous thing that for the sake of pushing cars that the market doesn't want then we destroy the Regal
value it's not a good idea so we try to be the good uh you know uh you know good
example on how you can you know you can actually manage that maybe I I'll take that as a cue and
bring in t to ask whether there's a risk on Financial Services here concerning
the lower than expected residual values on bvs in the market I mean could you
outline what the share of bvs in uh mobilizes books is at this point in time
and you know is there still room for RVs to fall further um before that starts
impacting your financials on the um FS business yeah so so hi Daniel so um look
it's a relatively small share in the books of mobilized Financial Services because you have basically you know
three three years of uh of financing in the books at any given moment and uh
over the last three years I would say EV is roughly around 10% of of our exposure
in in in Europe so it's relatively Limited um mobilize first uh you know
doesn't carry the risk on all of that portfolio either either you know that uh
uh the uh long-term lease um is uh quite a small portion at this at this stage uh
in terms of the financing structure so a big portion of the risk is actually uh carried either by the consumer or by the
retail network uh so it's not a very material exposure however uh we need to
manage it as Luca said um and um you know we always take very a
very prudent approach to it so we we're not making bets for the future we monitor it on a quarterly basis we
adjust uh the assumptions in terms of residual value based on what we do in
the market uh and we do um we say test the reuk you know sort of loop back
tests um every uh every closing with the team and we look at the gain or losses
that that we take in residual values and we're consistently very prudent uh so at this stage uh no no no worries but we'll
keep monitoring it for the for the future having um you know owning a bank uh with all the financial products and
different kind of paral I think it's an advantage in this respect so because we can uh you know we can actually Master
the game right on one cycle two cycles so so this is also one thing that you have to take into account in your in
your model foro thank you luk so now we have a than you thank you Daniel now we have a
question of Michael Jax from Bank of America Michael please could you open your
mic Michael the floor is yours hi good morning can you hear me
now yeah sure thank you I have two questions if I
may um the first one is on pricing um just want to want to find out
to what extent are the price reductions that you made on the mean e tech earlier
this year covered by raw material Tailwind because we appear that battery costs are declining quite materially um
versus competitiveness games and then on from that um you know with these
materal mind and following price cuts by um some of your peers specifically in
the SUV C segment do you believe that the €40,000 entry
price is now the correct level for the scenic or might you consider coming to Market at a slightly lower
level thank you uh hi so so look on um on the um the
reduction in price of mean you know our our approach is we reduce the cost first
and then we reduce the pricing second okay so that's what we're doing I won't go into the details of what
represents raw material versus uh versus sort of productivity It's a combination of both um I I can tell you that uh you
know our process as we launch every new EV vehicle is to look at the
improvements that we make uh from one generation to the next and explore the feasibility of changing sort of
retrofitting uh the previous car uh to take into consideration some some of the
Technic techical advances that we make on the new models and that's what we're doing on mean so we are making good
grounds in terms of uh in terms of cost reduction but raw material is is helping but I think the important message is we
do cost reduction first and then we do the pricing reduction after that uh to try to protect the margin of the car uh
on the second part uh the price positioning of sique uh the entry level is actually uh slightly less than 40 not
45 uh so it's a very well positioned car if you look at the competition including
Chinese competition uh SII is going to be very well
positioned thank you Cherry we now have thank you we now have a question from
pushkar telka HSBC pushkar please could you open your mic yeah uh thanks Philippine uh and
good morning everyone uh I have couple of questions so the first on the
guidance or uh just the assump ition behind it in terms of pricing mix versus
raw materials and effects do you think you can keep that net effect at neutral
in 2024 uh that's the first question and the second one is particularly on the
product mix and I understand the impact of the Cleo in the second half but given
the number of product launches that you're doing and especially the C segment M mix the negative print is a
bit underwhelming so do you see that reversing in 2024 now with the again the
C and D segment launches or because you keep the price low it's this this mix is
going to be weaker on the top line but let's say better on the profitability how do you see that
developing High push car thanks thanks for the questions uh so so on the first question pricing mix versus raw material
and effects uh yes the overall equation is going to continue to be positive uh I think uh as we saw in the second half
pricing is starting to ease um you know there's less pressure from raw material to offset Etc uh but uh we will continue
to do some pricing um and U one thing that we'll definitely continue to do is
offset foreign exchange with pricing uh you could see that uh This was done very well by the teams this year and uh we
we'll continue to do so uh so price will be a slight positive but not to the same extent as what we had in
2023 uh mix will be positive and I'll come back to that in in detail to answer your question uh raw material turns a
positive in the second half of this year so it was roughly 320 million negative
in the first half and you know million more um positive in the second half so
it's going to continue to help us um and then um you know I would say the big
change in terms of uh the geography of how the profit is going to come together
next year versus this year is that cost of good sold is finally going to become a Tailwind overall uh which is it hasn't
been for three or four years now so that's that's the big change now on your second question that's around mix so
first on 23 um you know at the turnover level um
uh the mix effect effect was slower in the second half because of Koo uh so it
it's hard to be uh disappointed with that we just have a situation where Cleo is selling very very well um and again
uh the beauty of it is that we took a lot of cost out so despite the fact that it's taking our average revenue per unit
slightly down it's actually improving uh on the margin on the margin side uh if
you project yourself into 2024 things are going to change slightly because we are launching uh a few cars that have um
you know quite a high net revenue per unit in particular sique the Reno 5
Rafal uh so we should see a mix effect that will be positive at the turnover
turnover level and we will continue to see the lift on the mix element at the
margin level thank you Cherry we now have a
question from roses JP Morgan Ros please could you open your
mic what say okay if it doesn't work um we'll
take a question from Philipa Jeff Philip please could you open your mic can you hear me H yeah can you hear
yeah okay yeah it just it takes a couple of seconds to me the phone here here thank you so much and congrats on the strong set of results luuka please a
couple of questions can you speak a little bit around the cost savings actions that you're looking to execute
in 2024 what are the biggest items you you're looking to execute within the business uh in the year to reduce the
the the cost pH and second can you comment on the uh potential collaboration with Volkswagen on a small
car uh I understand there was some discussions at the end of the year 2023 so we love to to hear a little bit more
um you know any thoughts regarding this project uh and second theory can you speak about three categories one what
your assumptions on Financial Services profits uh profitability in 2024 are you
looking for a slight decline of the earnings contribution uh second if I take the low
end of your margin guidance uh as a group are you still expecting uh margin
Improvement in the Auto Division I understand you are looking for for margin Improvement but the consensus
seems to be disagreeing with that view and then three can you talk about purchasing and Manufacturing costs in
the profit bridge for 2024 thank you um H um look on the cost reduction
uh I mean I mean we could talk about that for an hour but uh one of the things is important to to understand is
that on especially on the EV space the creation of a pair brings also another
approach to the management of the let's say development of the product and the
maintenance of the product so basically uh in the in the traditional world we
would you know concentrate developing a car and then the same team would go for
another Model come back to into the you know next generation for after five six years in the case of Aer because the
technology is very evolutionary people are on focus on the two platform that we
having to aare the whole time so if we find one day on Wednesday an opportunity to get 10 euros out of the thing we try
we try to do it okay and that's the kind of a spirit so uh we are working very hard uh to make sure uh that cost of EV
car goes down with some decision that we would have never made before okay I
think that the and it goes to the you to answer to your second question I'm not
sure I can really talk about potential collaboration with other oems the fact
is that with what we're doing on the twingo on the a segment we actually have
a you know a setup something that is from a
manufacturing point of view from a technology point that is pretty unique you don't have so many things like this
in Europe and because this segment historical was you know double digit in Europe and it went down like
you know to a single small single digit number there is potential it could be a very relevant segment and in the in the
in the world of EVS when you can reduce the battery to I don't know less than 30
kilowatt into the thing then you can get really competitive EVS that people can use and you can go into the volume so
some people are interested in doing that so my focus is to make sure that we can get the car out that is extremely
competitive in term of uh let's say technology cost uh and uh yeah so I
can't answer what what what's going on but I can tell you that we're working very very hard and even with with Jill
that is here I think we took the opportunity of this prod to completely revamp the product development uh you
know process at Renault to get the car done in around 20 years uh 20 sorry two
years two years which is uh I think uh it's pretty remarkable and so this is
now embedded and written on the stone at Reno and now we have to Pro you know we
have to prove that we can do it but everybody's very motivated because you know speed uh speed is going to become more
and more important in our industry especially if you want to face you know the Chinese that are very quick so it's
going to save us money and uh it's going to give us a chance to be always on the market when you need to
be thanks uh on on your financial questions on on
Financial Services um you know the contribution of MFS is going to be a a positive so it's going to be an increase
uh next year but primarily driven by the fact that we'll have the non-re repeat of the negative swaps valuation that we
had in the 23 numbers if you exclude that it will be flight flat to a slight
Improvement um the the cost of risk is uh is very low as you can see the
portfolio is very healthy I think uh it's important to understand that everything that we did to kind of
increase the average selling price on the vehicles both through vehicle mix and through the pricing actions is
benefiting to MFS in the sense because the ticket size is improving uh so we we should be seeing continued good
performance from uh from that side of uh of the group uh on the auto margin so
you know maybe it gives me an opportunity to come back to the impacts of horse um so if if you look at total
group margin um you know we ended up at 7.9 in this as I mentioned in the discussion there's
about 480 million that comes from uh the fact that we stopped am amortizing the
assets of horse which is basically 100 basis points of non-cash favorability so
that will not repeat um when we uh when we close uh the the deal uh and we get
regulatory approval as I mentioned we will start buying the parts from horse um so we in inside the price there will
be the cost of amortization which will resume and there will be a slight margin
so before we close we continue to get the lift from the fact that we're not
amortizing after we close it starts being a a slight negative in the
2024 uh construction what we've assumed is that net net all of this is a slight negative which means that if you look at
the 7.5% guidance it's really at least a 60 60 uh basis points Improvement uh
year-over-year and this comes mainly from the auto part of the business so
operationally absolutely the auto margin is going to continue to improve uh from a rate perspective and then your your
last question was on purchasing and cost reductions um you know as I mentioned
earlier um the the discussions on you know sort of compensation of uh
suppliers Etc are we're getting to the tail end of that the impact that it had
in the second half was a lot lower than in the first half um and so the progress
that we're making in discussions with suppliers is starting to pay off which means that the big change in 2024 versus
23 is that uh we're going to have a net gain in cost of good sold uh so that's good news going
forward thank you so much thank you we now have a question from Philip pwad
please Philip please could you open your mic yeah I think that's open you should
hear me now um couple of questions for me one is um I'm surprised I'm the first
one asking about this Argentina um effect um this is not a recurring effect
so can you why why should we treat it as a recurring or or not take it out of of
of the ebit in which case you would have missed your numbers what am I missing there and I have another question after
that sure uh so so Argentina um so this this subscription
plan is the way it works is basically uh people group it's group of actually
technically 168 people and and they contribute to a pool uh between 84 and
120 months so seven years or 10 years okay and every month they pay a contribution to the pool right and they
pay a subscription fees and and stuff like that and once uh the pool
collectively has reached uh the the amount that finances a car a car is
allocated uh to the pool right and so every month each group gets two cars one
we pick the client based on a draw and the other we pick the client based on a bidding war okay um and uh then we ship
the car to the two people who are lucky enough to get it um so um ba basically
uh this year we did price increases to offset the foreign exchange um so really
the way you should look at the impact of the rbo plan this pool this year is
compensation for FX so if you look at our total operating margin for Argentina it was basically flat year-over-year and
this is nothing else than more pricing but on a different type of sales right it's going to continue to be this way uh
in the coming year although maybe to a lesser extent because um uh because
hopefully the inflation starts to abide uh but uh there's no you know sort of
oneoff per se it's a price increase to compensate foreign exchange the price increases are it's a given right so
there's no going back um and uh as I mentioned you know uh out of the 1.5
billion of operating margin increase uh none of it comes off comes from argintina it's an offset of effects
which will continue in the future okay no that makes sense I I appreciate that cuz it was uh it looked
like a convenient one off otherwise and by the way um you know all all the or
most of the auto manufacturers uh do this in Argentina it's a way to U give
access to mobility in an affordable fashion uh for the clients and in a situation where uh there's very high
inflation uh people are actually buying cars so that they have an asset that they can rely on you know it's like a
almost an investment so it's it's a it's a it's a successful plan but all in all
for us it was about offsetting effects and we'll continue to do so in in the following years okay and my other question was on
on the product um I think the big Improvement we've seen over the last few years is definitely a Revival of the
Renault brand itself the contribution of the models of those those those cars um the question I have is on on Dasia and
on Vans um you you've it's a big business of van but you a smaller player
compared to some of your competitor s and I'm just wondering can you confirm that Vans are rective to group margins
uh still and the other question I have is on desia I think Dasia for many years had a lower cost base because he was
kind of using kind of hand me- down platforms from previous runal cars today
the technology required to build to Dasia is more sophisticated so your cost is going up your pricing is going up as
well but can we be still comfortable that this this kind of exceptional margin you've had on Dasia will
continue um because effect you the cost base of the Dasa cars I think structurally is going up um and you last
you can confirm that you still have a very very high share of retail buyers in the in theia brand thank
you Philip I'm surprised you're asking the question such kind of question because you know has since many many
years so you should know that lcv at Rena is actually a creative to the you
know to the business we do I just want to hear it you confirm it yeah I can confirm you and and you know what what's
happening normally normally the master so the the Evan is the cashow uh into
the thing so you normally have very long Cycles uh you know and maybe 10 12 years
cycle but when you come with a new car you normally have a very very big effect on profitability okay so the product is
very very competitive we have uh we have the kangu that is 2 three years old is doing well we have uh we have traffic
that we probably renovate but it's in the middle of the life cycle that works also very well if you took if you take
only brand Renault is number one in Europe on on on on Commercial Vehicle of
course if other people are using uh you know the same car and they change badges
you know you sum up everything but from customer point of view as a brand we are very strong there and on the data you
know of course we have a challenge you have Denise here maybe you will had something on it but um you know when you look at the
position of the cars we talked about early about spring Etc but also Su number one uh car in retail since you
know many many years why is this because we have a clear advantage in fact what you have to understand is that on the B
segment we in Renault unlike other oems we have two level of construction the
same uh platform okay one way we call cmfb Global access and the other one
which is the IEC version of of the thing and that's what we used for data and
what we decided two three years ago was to say okay for sure regulation and new
technology will push up the cost of the thing data will always have to be relatively to his competition you know
with a big you know cost Advantage which is still the case and even it will be
also still the case for Next Generation cars but on top of that we will give thata we will break the crystal ceiling
that uh in the past was kind of given to the data boys and girls that they could
not enter the C segment okay so you look at the dust Next Generation in terms of
performance is almost a c segment car in terms of price is very competitive but people will buy you know will not buy a
car for €10,000 but maybe for 25 30,000 and then I can tell you we make
money and when the big Ser will come it will be the same it will be even better and it's based on the B segment platform
so I think that the data receipt is still valid the challenge that we we
have is how do we handle the same approach when the market will turn to uh
EV okay so if uh if D will have to sell majority of EVS we need to find the
solution but we have a little bit of time of course we are working on it it's an issue probably for 28 uh something
for the renovation of the uh sandero uh you know a family of of cars so we are
we know it and we are working on it and I think technology will evolve in batteries and also cost so we will be
there at the right time okay I don't know Den if you want to add something said all to answer precisely your
question we are 84% retail sales and we continue doing so as Luca was saying we
do great results as you could see on the B mostly Brand number two and a solid double digit uh operating profit and and
now for the next almost decade or at least seven years we're just starting the game on the ceg which will be even
more profitable for us so so the future is great still re reusing the same assets this is all based on the same
cmfb platform all of all all that we do we started the sandero two years ago and
now we are growing on the ceg and we even leverage those assets in the International International operations
of Reno so this is potentially up to 2 million business that we are talking on the same platform so we still continue
milking the cow for for long years ahead of us thank you thank you Den uh we now
have a question from ening kman bares ening please could you open your
mic any could you hear
us okay if it doesn't work we will take the next question from Tom B Tom please
could you open your mic sure I think you can hear me yeah
hello Tom okay great hello Philippine hello everyone thank you for taking my question uh I'd like to start first with
with your uh balance sheet I mean you've been generating a very strong amount of cash uh could could you confirm you
should get in theory a rating upgrade relatively quickly uh from a SNP and and
remind us what the impact uh on your expected cash returns uh notably talking
about uh uh what is the plan for uh disposing of more of the Nissan shares
over the coming months or or years uh second uh question totally unrelated uh
there's going to be a lot of uh decisions from the people and and
politics that are going to impact your business in Europe substantially between the Parliament election in Europe in June uh
the European commission decision on on taxes on on Chinese cars and other type
of of of Elections while consumers seem to be increasingly reluctant to buy the
car that politics and and regulation want them to buy uh can you talk about
the flexibility uh Rena has going forward uh if the penetration of bvs
naturally in Europe gets at a much lower pce than expected uh and remind us the
proportion of bvs you have to sell in 25 to continue to sell the other cars uh
and last question uh you talked about impairments uh so I'm back for a
question to to T probably more can can you talk about what you impaired uh and uh and whether there's potentially a
risk related to just my second question on potentially further impairments on on BS should you have to reinvest
eventually more than you thought in ice territories thank you
you can start through the first one I go for the second uh okay uh so so so look
um on the uh on the rating um unfortunately it's not 100% under our
control uh because our friends at the rating agencies have their processes as you know uh we're in constant
discussions with them we gave them a a preview of these results which they uh
they you know Moody's and S&P both thought were very encouraging and actually slightly above what they
expected um so you know I I think we're on the right track we meet technically
the financial criteria uh to be investment grade uh but then you know they also have sort of more subjective
elements that they need to take into consideration you know how our EV business is going to develop Etc uh but
we're hopeful uh that we're going to get a reating relatively soon um uh in terms of effect on the
financials you know our spread has improved quite a bit bit with the Improvement of the financial performance
uh without regardless of the rating change however we still have you know
almost 100 basis points of difference versus the best inclass in the automotive market and so 100 basis
points on you know roughly 15 billion of debt gives you uh gives you an idea of
you know the incremental benefit that we could get once uh once we achieve that um on the last question oh sorry on on
the Nissan shares look I mean you know the the new structure that we've put in
place where we've placed the a portion of the shares in the trust the intent is
to rebalance to 1515 so uh clearly you know that's the intent the calendar is
not set I mean a bunch of conditions need to be fulfilled for us to continue
to come down you know one of the of the elements is the appetite of Nissan to do
some more uh BuyBacks uh Stephen my counterpart at Nissan indicated during
their earnings call that they had capacity uh to do a little bit um um so
that will be a positive uh but we have to look at uh you know several other conditions and importantly what we're
going to do with the cach and how we redeploy it so the intent is there the calendar is is obviously not set and
then on your question on the impairments before I give the floor to LC like every
every year we do a complete review of uh of the of the vehicle range and and
assess the business plan and the recoverability of the value of the assets uh this year uh we decided to do
an impairment uh uh on on mean and I think we took into consideration the
revised volume profile coming from the performance of the car and also coming from the market and we thought it was
good to adjust the value uh and it represents a large portion of uh of the impairments figure that you saw uh I
think going forward um you know we've reviewed the profile of all the other programs and so far it looks like U you
know they're you know significantly above the water so so no issue we'll continue to look at it on a regular
basis what I can tell you is um you know technology is advancing and so for
example in software um we used to capitalize we don't capitalize anymore like for
example software defined vehicle uh we've decided not to capitalize uh and to let those cost go through the p&l
directly uh to be conservative so you should see the capitalization ratio
start to go down in 2024 and the years after that because as
you mentioned the technology is a bit riskier and we want to be prudent but uh
other than that no change in the process and we'll keep reviewing it on a regular basis thank you much can I just have a
ask a quick follow up on this Bean impairments is that's okay before L answer the other question did you have
to make any enough payments to some of the suppliers that obviously faced a
totally different volume than expected there yeah there's a portion of of the cost that we took which is a
compensation of volume shortfall uh not necessarily a very large portion but uh
but we included everything in in that review thank you much um hi phip um so
um um I mean from a from a Pro point of view on in Europe I think nothing will
be now decided before the new Parliament is elected so we'll see what happens
with the election um what I want to say is that uh you know everybody now is like three
years ago you would tell us that if we would not do 100% electric cars we would be a bunch of
zombies uh you know walking around and now you you're telling us that you know EV is not going to work I don't think
this will be the case I think EV will continue to be you know will will grow in Europe and will become a dominant
technology for a simple reason we talk about you know Parliament regulation you
talk about you know deadline in 2035 revision close in 2026 but this is
something that everybody forgets and this is the fact that uh we have Cafe
regulation and with Cafe regulation you have to do in 2025 that means in 8 months time from now you got to do below
100 GS of uh of CO2 in average for the fleet and the best combustion engine is
like maybe 80 grams with hybrid and in 2030 you need to do 50 so you don't need
you know you know you don't need to be a Nobel Prize in mathematics to understand
that you need to sell a lot of electric cars so we will we will you know for sure push them okay and we will create
the offer and we will work also with other industry to make uh sure that this
thing works because it's also good for the environment right so I think that electrica will be dominant uh technology
in the long term we have bumps up and downs it's not three months of change
that will change the thing but in the case of Renault right from the beginning we always said we're going to to play on
both sides because Rena actually has one of the best hybrid in the world with e
tech okay very modular technology very competitive Etc and that's why we you
know we are pushing on that that's why we did horse because it's going to give us uh you know we do a old school game
of putting things together finding productivity synergies etc etc we have
potential to reinvent things to develop you know this technology to develop the thing from a fuel fuel point of view and
on the other side we do aair be to focus on a new sport which is e and aair is
you know designed not you know to be focused on that but it's also not it's
kind of a relatively asset like organization I think that aair I think
we gave this number we probably be you know on break even around 300,000 unit
uh with that system we have a capacity you know theoretical capacity
of 600,000 for the time time being if we push everything but already at 300 we are you know we are making money I don't
remember what was the number of uh sgna on ampare is like 2 2.5% s GNA on ampare
so we only have an ampare what is right and what is important to do electric cars so I think Rena is actually in a
very very favorable position to master the you know the transition and to play
you know on the piano where where we need to play this is the
reality of thing very good hybrid technology and very focused on the with
experience so we'll see but let's not give up the fact that uh we need to push
progress and technology in the automotive industry because that's important for Europe and yeah and for
the people from the environment right thank you R thank you to uh we now have a question
from George gers Goldman Sachs George please could you open your
mic yeah for taking my questions um I actually wanted to ask two questions
which were more industry related because I think if we look at Rano you've delivered record results you clearly
have all the foundations in place for your EV strategy but the market
obviously isn't giving you full credit for that and I think some of the Market's concerns around the industry r
y so just with respect to End Market developments in the state of end markets
we've seen you get your inventories very much in shape and flat year-over-year
but when you look around do you think there is now excess inventory in your
end markets and significant risk to pricing or would you describe the health
of the M markets is still being a very good one um and certainly significantly
better than what we saw in the past the second question I had which really relates a little bit to what we were
just discussing is regarding the cafe standards as mentioned you have ampair
you have exciting new products with the R5 and the twingo you clearly have done
a huge amount to get your cost position very competitive but the same can't necessarily be said for all your
competitors do you get any sense that the industry would look to try and push
back the cafe standards and do you think there is any scope for that to happen
post this year's elections maybe uh George hi I I I'm
going to start with the your second question I I actually think that I have never heard
someone uh you know questioning the cafe standard I mean Cafe is not only for Europe you have that kind of uh system
in many areas of the world so a lot of discussion on of course regulation Euro 7 you you've seen the things and you
know deadlines whether it should be 35 40 uh you know revision close ET but I
have never heard anybody actually let's say discussing about that so because this thing is embedded in the system
since I don't know how many years right like probably 10 years it was yeah and
even more so the fact is that again that we're going to have to be below 100 in
2025 uh that means basically it's very early right so our estimation is that you got to be uh maybe a 25% mix of EVS
to get there right uh we we the average of the market this year was 16 so we're
not so far away from the thing there will be a lot of offer coming um and uh
but to to be uh at 50 you have to sell majority of the cars
in in 2030 as a zero emission so either it's in current regulation it's either
electric or hydrogen car so I think that the the oems and the industry will push
for that of course you have a lot of things that you have to fix you know and as as we said infrastructure and of
course this market so far is very dependent on subsidies because the cost
of the product is structurally higher than classical IC uh but it will come
down okay uh so I have to say that uh you know when I hear now that people
everybody is questioning the thing and putting a kind of a shadow on the potential performance of the industry
because of that I found it a little bit like dangerous right so the industry has
put as far as I know in Europe maybe something like 250 billion Euro on
electric thing on the value chain so now this this investment has to return and
we will make it we'll make it work in the case of Renault uh I think we have a you know we
of course we have aair but there's something that will help us is that we are the first one to to have a b segment
Next Generation EV platform okay that will underpin products like Renault 5 Renault 4 Alpine uh you know the Micra
from Nissan etc etc and you know basically mechanically because this
platform is you know maybe 30% cheaper than the let's say mean cic
platform uh you know mechanically we will bring down the access to EV uh in
terms of budget for the custom by you know 30 35% and this is where in a lot of Market
uh you know where you find the customers you don't find the customers at 45,000
but you know below 30,000 you find them right a lot uh so I think we have um we
have a a couple of years of Advantage there I think by the way also the you know the chines are very strong in C
segment C segment SUV and you know and higher segment that's not M there's no
much offer even in China for small cars but European people they buy small cars
look at you know look at the you know top five cars you have cars like you know the 208 the Cleo the sandero etc
etc so this is this is where you sell car in Europe and we have and we are the first one to have
such kind of thing so I think we will go through 2025 I mean based on our estimation right now we will pass 2025
and then we'll have to find a solution to get to
2030 thank you Luka uh we now have a question from PI K Pi please could you
open your mic I think it's open um hi good morning
uh to everyone thanks for taking a question Pi with Ste um actually I got three question um could you
confirm um TI that the starting point of the 2024 margin guide is restated for
the forse impact so 7.5% plus Outlook is built on 6.9% Landing point in
2023 uh yeah to make sure I understand your question uh the the
7.5 is built on the on the 6.9 yes so uh again uh you know we've assumed that the
net impact of horse in 24 is actually a slight negative again because until we
de we deconsolidate it's a positive through the fact that we stopped the
amortization after the deconsolidation it's a slight negative
because we start paying the margin uh to hold course the net net that we've Incorporated in the 7.5 is a slight
negative so you should see the 7.5 comparable at least to the 6.9 so at
least a 60 basis points Improvement hopefully that answers your question yeah that was the the direction
of my question um and the the the the headwind from horse in 24 uh should be
captured in the manufa in cost bucket I suspect right in uh yeah in the cost in
the cost bucket absolutely yes um second point is uh would it would it be fair
for 2024 to assume that volume should be a Tailwind for for Rena likely low
single digit on higher shipments but not necessarily in the first quarter which
could still be negative or I am too pessimistic for the full year or a for
the first quarter I think your assumptions are is correct I mean I think in q1 of last
year we were still in the phase where you know components availability was coming back Etc uh overall for the year
you know we we always take a conservative approach on on the volume assumptions uh you know we're as Luca
mentioned we're launching 10 cars the last thing we want is people to push them and not maximize the pricing so
we've we will get uh some kind of low single digigit growth year-over-year but
it it will be a Tailwind yes okay thanks last on free cash flow
um uh your guide for 24 um should include roughly 1 billion of onair cash
bar or onair funding right well something like that I mean we
had said when we did the ampare CMD that it would be 1.5 billion over the uh the
period of uh uh 24 and first half of 20 and the cash burn is is included
obviously in the projection that we've given you so you know again uh it's it's
uh it's good that you pointed out uh because I've I've seen you know questions on whether we're able to fund
opare Etc the cash that we've generated in 2023 uh covering the cash burn of aare
is more than two times the cash burn of aare coming in the next two years so there's there's absolutely Z zero
question that we could keep funding on pair with the cash generation of the group and that's what we're we're going to continue to
do I'm afraid sorry sorry Pierre I I'm afraid we have to uh stop because we
have to go to the media so sorry for that uh so I just want to you know thank
you for being with us uh this uh hour and a half and uh so have a good day and
see you soon I hope thank you very much guys
